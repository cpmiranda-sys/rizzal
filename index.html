                <h3>Introduction and Filing of the Rizal Bill</h3>
                <p>On April 3, 1956, Senate Bill No. 438, also known as the Rizal Bill, was introduced by Senator Jose P. Laurel, Chair of the Senate Committee on Education. This bill proposed that all public and private schools in the Philippines include courses on the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal, particularly his novels *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" data-aos="slide-right">
                <h3>Opposition and Controversy</h3>
                <p>The bill encountered strong opposition, especially from the Catholic Church, due to the controversial nature of Rizal’s works, which criticized the clergy. This opposition created significant debates between the Church’s allies and those supporting the bill, including Claro M. Recto and Francisco “Soc” Rodrigo, who led the discussions in favor of the bill.</p>

            <div class="box" data-aos="slide-left">
                <h3>Debates and Amendments</h3>
                <p>Debates on the bill began in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. A similar version of the bill, House Bill No. 5561, was filed on April 19, 1956, by Representative Jacobo Z. Gonzales. The House Committee on Education approved the bill without amendments, but the debates, which started on May 9, 1956, centered around the compulsory reading of the unexpurgated versions of Rizal's novels. To address concerns, Senator Laurel proposed amendments, including removing the requirement to read the novels in their unedited form and including other writings of Rizal.</p>

            <div class="box" data-aos="slide-right">
                <h3>Approval and Final Steps</h3>
                <p>The amended bill was eventually agreed upon by both houses of Congress. However, technical delays nearly halted its passage, as the House was about to adjourn and President Magsaysay had not prioritized the bill. Skillful negotiations ensured that no further amendments were added, and the bill was transmitted to the President without delay. On June 12, 1956, President Ramon Magsaysay signed the bill into law, officially making it Republic Act No. 1425, also known as the Rizal Law.</p>

                <h3>Impact of the Rizal Law</h3>
                <p>The Rizal Law mandated the inclusion of courses on the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal in all educational institutions in the Philippines. It also authorized the distribution of inexpensive copies of *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo* and their translations into various Philippine languages, ensuring that Rizal’s ideas continue to inspire future generations of Filipinos.</p>
